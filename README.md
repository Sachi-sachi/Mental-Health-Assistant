Mental health support is a growing concern worldwide, yet accessible and personalized assistance remains limited. This paper presents RAG Care, a conversational mental wellness assistant focused on depression-related queries, which leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create accurate and empathetic responses. The system 
integrates a knowledge base of counseling questions and answers (the CounselChat dataset) with large language models (specifically a custom LLaMA3 based 8B model) to retrieve relevant expert advice and 
generate helpful answers in real-time. Key components of the methodology include data preprocessing (filtering and organizing Q&A pairs on depression), vector embedding of texts, and a hybrid search 
mechanism using Elasticsearch for high-relevance document retrieval. We evaluate the system using retrieval metrics like Hit Rate and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to compare different strategies. 
Experimental results show that augmenting the LLM with retrieved knowledge substantially improves response relevance (e.g., vector search achieves a Hit@5 of ~78.9% vs ~50.4% with baseline lexical 
search). The proposed RAG-based assistant demonstrates the potential for delivering reliable, up to-date mental health guidance at scale.
